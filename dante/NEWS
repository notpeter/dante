***  Wednesday, September 3, 2014 -- Dante v1.4.1
***

 o Fixed configure problem with detection of libc.so on recent FreeBSD
   versions.
   Problem report and testing by Mikhail <mp39590@gmail.com.example.com>.

 o Fixed problem in configure test used for figuring out which
   buffer in an IPC socket is used for determining bytes that can
   be buffered.  Should fix problem on FreeBSD.

   Diagnosed in detail by Mikhail <mp39590@gmail.com.example.com>.
   Also reported by Carlos Jacobo Puga Medina <cpm@fbsd.es.example.com>.

 o Fixed bug in handling of buffered GSSAPI data.

 o Added keywords for specifying that only IPv4 or IPv6 should be used
   on internal or external interfaces.

 o Fix bug that prevented external.rotation: same-same from working correctly.
   Reported by Alexander.V.Makkoveev (makkoveev@gmail.com.example.com).

 o AIX 6.1 compilation fixes.

 o NetBSD 6.1.3 gethostbyaddr() configure fix.
   Problem reported by Anthony Howe <achowe@snert.com.example.com>.

 o Use wait3(2) rather than wait4(2), as the latter (implemented as a
   wrapper on Solaris) has a bug on Solaris in the handling of the WAIT_ANY
   value.  This is -1 traditionally, but on Solaris wait4(2) is expecting
   it to be the value 0. This change also fixes a similar problem on AIX.

 o Remove extra CRLF from CONNECT request, as in patch submitted by
   "Dyson, Brian J" <Brian.Dyson@ca.com.example.com>.

***
***  Monday, November 18, 2013 -- Dante v1.4.0
***

 o Older syntax for setting the socket buffer sizes via
   socket.recvbuf.udp, socket.sendbuf.udp, socket.recvbuf.tcp and
   socket.sendbuf.tcp options have been deprecated and replaced with
   the more general API for setting socket options.

   "socket.recvbuf.udp" can now be set by "<interface-side>.udp.so_rcvbuf"
   "socket.sendbuf.udp" can now be set by "<interface-side>.udp.so_sndbuf"
   "socket.recvbuf.tcp" can now be set by "<interface-side>.tcp.so_rcvbuf"
   "socket.sendbuf.tcp" can now be set by "<interface-side>.tcp.so_sndbuf"

   <interface-side> refers to either "internal", for Dante's internal
   interface(s), or "external", for Dante's external interface(s).

 o socks-rules now require a "socks" prefix (like client-rules require a
   "client" prefix), and the socks "method" keyword has been renamed to
   "socksmethod".

 o The "socksmethod" keyword can now be set in client-rules too.  It
   is used to override the default preference for what socksmethod to
   select for which clients addresses, making it possible to by
   default e.g., have the preference "gssapi username none", but for
   some client-ranges have a different preference, e.g., "none
   username gssapi".

   Normally there is no need to use set this keyword in a client-rule.

 o Fallback to direct (non-proxy) routes now defaults to off in the client,
   as well as in the server.

   To keep previous behaviour in the client, with direct route fallback
   for destinations with no matching route, set SOCKS_DIRECTROUTE_FALLBACK
   to "yes" in the environment, or ./configure with --enable-drt-fallback.

   Direct fallback is enabled if there are no routes configured (as is
   usually the case in a server configuration), and disabled otherwise.

 o IPv6 is now supported in the server.

   Standard IPv6 address syntax is used for addresses, with the addition
   of the special address "0/0" used for matching both all IPv4 and
   all IPv6 addresses.

 o New "monitor" object added.  Syntax is similar to rules and routes,
   but instead of applying to individual sessions, it applies to all
   sessions currently matching the addresses to monitor.

   This can be used for monitoring network anomalies related to too
   little data being transferred or too many disconnects occurring,
   triggering alarms if detected.

 o Possibility to configure system errors and DNS-errors for
   special logging in certain cases (when connecting and performing
   hostname resolving).

 o More aggressive regarding how many processes to fork when starting
   and how many processes to reserve for future clients.

 o Added new log keyword: "tcpinfo".  Used to report more extensive
   statistics about sessions, including TCP_INFO on supported platforms.

 o SIGINFO/SIGUSR1 output is now logged at level "info" instead of level
   "debug".

 o SIGHUP code rewritten.  Should function considerably better in
   environments were SIGHUP is, for whatever reason, sent an excessive
   amount of times every second.

 o Default for the maximum number of clients an i/o process can handle has
   been increased from 8 to 32.

 o Improved UDP compatibility by sending appropriate ICMP unreachable
   errors to clients and targets, if running with the appropriate
   privileges (typically, root is required for this).

   Makes it possible for a client or target to be notified that a UDP
   packet it wanted the Dante server to forward was not forwarded.

 o Reduction in memory consumption at the expense of allocating extra
   memory dynamically in the very rare, perhaps non-existing, cases
   where the extra memory is needed.

 o The default timeout for TCP i/o (timeout.io.tcp) has been changed from
   84000 to 0.  0 means use the kernels default, which in most cases will
   mean no timeout.  See UPGRADE for more information.

 o The session module has been merged with the mainstream Dante code,
   and has also been extended to support the following new features:
     - connection throttling (number of new sessions accepted per second).
     - state-keys.
       Two state keys are currently supported:
         - per-IP address.
         - per-hostid (hostid is supported on certain platforms, with
                       certain kernel patches, with certain clients).

   The syntax has also changed (see UPGRADE).
   See the manual for more information about the new features.

 o Code used for finding the correct outgoing address to bind when
   external.rotation is set to "route" replaced with much simpler,
   but hopefully equally (or better) functioning code.
   Idea taken from Quagga.

 o Use getpassphrase() rather then getpass() to obtain password for
   username authentication when available. Avoids 9 character limit
   on Solaris.  Suggested by Albert Fluegel <af@muc.de.example.com>

 o Use sqrt() rather than sqrtl() in stddev calculation, as sqrtl() is not
   available on some platforms (such as FreeBSD 7.2).  Problem reported
   by Rudolf Polzer <rpolzer@one-it.de.example.org>.

 o If the authentication method used was RFC931 (ident), the username
   was not always logged when it should be.
   Reported by Gregory Charot (EVENIUM) <gcharot@evenium.com.example.com>.

 o Syntax checking has been improved to better detect invalid or
   likely incorrect server configurations.

   This can result in some configurations that have previously been
   accepted or accepted with warnings by Dante, to now cause an error
   on startup, preventing the Dante server from starting up until the
   configuration error has been fixed.

 o Fixed compilation on OpenBSD with compilers not supporting -Wbounded.
   Problem report and testing by
   Mikael More <mikael.more@gmail.com.example.com>.

 o GSSAPI "clear" is no longer enabled by default, as it is not part
   of the SOCKS GSSAPI standard per se.

 o external.rotation was not handling non-IPv4 target addresses correctly.
   Reported and diagnosed by Rudolf Polzer <rpolzer@one-it.de.example.com>.

 o The "--disable-libwrap" option has been renamed "--without-libwrap".

 o Fixed bug that would cause the following warning to sometimes be
   erroneously reported:
   "warning: accept(2) failed: Resource temporarily unavailable"

 o SIGINFO log information extended to include information about i/o
   buffer status and as well as UDP packet latency.

 o Real-time scheduling priority settings and CPU affinity settings made
   available in sockd.conf.

   See https://www.inet.no/dante/files/dante_realtime_preview.pdf for
   a performance analysis done in relation to these new features.

 o General API for setting socket options on sockets used by Dante
   made available in sockd.conf.

 o Support for cross compilation of client library for Android
   (system name 'arm-linux-androideabi').
   Testing and analysis by Yoav Weiss <weiss.yoav@gmail.com.example.com>.

 o Problem with sockd.init generation in dante.spec fixed.
   Reported by Luiz Gustavo Nascimento <luizgn@gmail.com.example.com>.

***
***  Thursday, August 4, 2011 -- Dante v1.3.2
***

 o Part of the possible resource optimization indicated in section 4.4
   of the Dante 1.3.1 performance evaluation report
   (http://www.inet.no/dante/doc/1.3.x/dante_performance_1.3.1.pdf)
   has been implemented: scheduling new clients to the Dante process
   with fewest free slots available.

 o If a proxy server (socks, http, or upnp) is configured via
   environment variables, don't attempt to also parse any socks.conf
   files.

 o The "HTTP_PROXY" environment variable has been renamed to
   "HTTP_CONNECT_PROXY" to avoid conflict with HTTP proxies that do not
   support the HTTP CONNECT request.

 o Fixed an unintended change to ACL semantics regarding bind requests in
   Dante 1.2.3.
   Noted by Ralf Wenk <Ralf.Wenk@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com>.  Many thanks.

 o Fixed a bug regarding handling of cases where the ulimit for max number
   of files is unlimited.  Reported and analyzed by
   Ralf Wenk <Ralf.Wenk@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com>.

 o Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.1 related to privileges during startup
   on Solaris.

***
***  Tuesday, June 21, 2011 -- Dante v1.3.1
***

 o Fixed a bug regarding handling of socks clients that do not follow the
   spec and start sending traffic data before request has been granted.

 o Fixed an error related to ACL on UDP-packets.  If a given SOCKS
   client was allowed to send some UDP packets, in some cases packets
   from the same SOCKS client that should have been blocked were allowed.

***
***  Tuesday, June 14, 2011 -- Dante v1.3.0
***

 o Fixed a bug related to parsing the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.
   Problem reported by John Fletcher <john.fletcher@rd.bbc.co.uk.example.com>.
   Note that the format of the HTTP_PROXY variable has also changed.

 o Logfiles can now be added or changed in sockd.conf after startup.

 o The priority of proxy routes has changed, so that a SOCKS v4 route is
   now preferred over a SOCKS v5 route when both can be used, because
   v4 requests can be performed faster than v5 requests.

 o Support for a new module, providing LDAP based authorisation.
   Developed by Markus Moeller (markus_moeller at compuserve.com).

   Note that modules need to be purchased separately.
   See "http://www.inet.no/dante/module.html" for more information about
   Dante modules.

 o Resource requirements have been significantly reduced.
   Performance has also been improved.

 o When checking whether a username is member of a group, as used in
   in group-based authentication checks, also check against the
   primary groupname of the user, as listed in /etc/passwd or similar,
   rather than only against the entries in /etc/group or similar.

   Based on a patch from Ralf Wenk <Ralf.Wenk@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com>.
   Thanks.

 o The socket buffer sizes can now be set in sockd.conf.  The default
   value is 0, which lets the kernel choose the buffer sizes itself.

 o A new keyword has been added to the configuration files: "errorlog".
   The syntax is the same as for the "logoutput" keyword, but
   "errorlog" is used to specify how errors, and only errors, should
   be logged.

   The meaning of the "logoutput" keyword has not changed, and will
   still log errors if configured to do so.

 o "child.maxidle: yes" is now the default setting, meaning most idle
   sockd child processes will be terminated automatically.

 o A bug that prevented binding privileged ports in the client from working
   has been fixed.
   Bug reported by Christophe Réquillart <requillart@gmail.com.example.com>

 o Two new timeout parameters have been added to sockd.conf:
   - "timeout.connect":
     This controls how many seconds the server will wait for a connect
     initiated on behalf of the SOCKS-client to complete.  The default
     is 30.  Setting it to 0 will use the kernel default.

   - "timeout.tcp_fin_wait":
     This controls the equivalent of TCP FIN-WAIT-2.

     Note that FIN-WAIT-2 is a normal TCP state.  Having many tcp
     connections stuck in this state does not indicate something is wrong,
     but it can create a resource problem for the kernel if there are
     too many of them.

     The default value is 0, meaning, let the kernel handle it as before
     rather than for Dante to time out sessions in this state.

 o "timeout.connect" is now supported also in socks.conf.  The value
   overrides the default timeout when the client attempts to connect
   to the SOCKS server.

 o The different server timeouts (negotiate, connect, i/o) can now be
   set on a rule-by-rule basis, and not just globally for all rules.

 o The config.h variables MAX_ROUTE_FAILS and BADROUTE_EXPIRE can now
   set in the configuration files instead of at compile time.
   The new values are "route.maxfail" and "route.badexpire" and control
   how to handle bad routes (to e.g., a SOCKS/HTTP proxy server).

 o Support for a new value for the "external.rotation" keyword: "same-same".
   This will tell the Dante server to use the same address for outgoing
   connections as the address the SOCKS client was accepted on, i.e.,
   one of the internal addresses.

   Based on a patch from Lysenko Konstantin <gshaud@gmail.com.example.com>.
   Thanks.

 o Fixed a bug where we could end up exiting if we got a SIGHUP
   at a point where we had no more free file descriptors, and
   thus could not reopen the sockd.conf.
   Problem reported by Mark Sinner <mark.sinner@db.com.example.com>.

 o The most time consuming part of the work performed by the request
   children (waiting for connect(2) to complete) has been moved to the
   i/o children.

   This should reduce the total number of sockd processes necessary to
   handle medium and higher loads, since the request children can only
   handle one client at a time, while the i/o children can handle many.

 o The "srchost" parameter "nomismatch" has been renamed to "nodnsmismatch",
   while "nounknown" has been renamed to "nodnsunknown".

   The "nodnsmismatch" and "nodnsunknown" functionality is now
   implemented internally in sockd, rather than via libwrap; there is
   no longer any dependency on libwrap ("tcp_wrappers") when using
   these options.

 o BSD authentication support on OpenBSD.

 o Option ordering in sockd.conf is now enforced, rather than just
   recommended.  Server options now always have to come before rules
   and routes.

 o The file to write the pid to can now be specified on the command line
   using the "-p" option.

 o If TMPDIR is not set, temporary files will be created in the
   current working directory when sockd is started.  If this fails,
   temporary files will be created in "/tmp" as before.

 o A 64-bit version of libdsocks is now built on 64-bit OpenSolaris machines.
   Should make socksify work with 64-bit applications.

 o Fix compilation on machines with Linuxthreads. Locking via
   Linuxthreads is however not supported.

   Problem report and testing by
   Nicolas VANHAUTE <nicolas.vanhaute@ac-clermont.fr.example.com>

 o Fix usage of negation operation in shell scripts causing problems
   for socksify when using Bourne shell on Solaris 8.
   Problem reported by Sebastian Kayser <skayser@opencsw.org.example.com>.

 o Size of byte and packet counters used for logging changed to 64 bits.

 o IBM Visual Age C/C++ V8 compilation fixes for AIX.
   Problem reported by Kieron Curtis2 <KCURTIS2@uk.ibm.com.example.com>

***
***  Monday, March 21, 2011 -- Dante v1.2.3

 o Fix problem introduced in version 1.2.1, causing the SO_REUSEADDR
   flag to not be set. Would cause problems during server restart if
   only the main process was killed.

   Thanks to Ralf Wenk <Ralf.Wenk@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com> for
   reporting this problem.

 o The regular expression for host and interface name parsing has been
   relaxed somewhat, allowing the use of some interface names and host
   names containing characters that were not allowed previously.

   Fixes problem reported by karesmakro <ipcop@it-connect-unix.de.example.com>,
   Ralf Wenk <Ralf.Wenk@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com>,
   and <Adam.Barclay@barclayscapital.com.example.com>.

 o The traffic log format has been slightly extended and now includes
   complete information about all communication endpoints, for both
   normal usage and with server chaining.

 o Compilation fixes for older Linux distributions.

 o Fix bug where the Solaris capabilities were not correctly
   added/removed at all times.

 o Compilation fixes for AIX 6.1.  Problem report and testing by
   Ville O Kesola <ville.kesola@fi.ibm.com.example.com> and
   Ralf Wenk <iz-dante-0910@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com>.

 o Fix PAM bug introduced in v1.2.0 that would leak resources when
   using PAM.  Also relax the code handling PAM concerning
   unknown msg_styles.

 o Set PAM_RUSER so that rhosts-based PAM authentication can work.

 o Wrapper for calling getsockopt(2) with SO_ERROR added.

 o Compilation fixes for AIX 6.1.
   Problem reported by Ralf Wenk <iz-dante-0910@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com>.
   Note to Ralf Wenk: we have been unable to contact you on the email

 o GSSAPI support is no longer disabled on Heimdal versions older than
   0.8.0, which have no wrap/unwrap support for aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96.
   The following krb5.conf configuration might be needed to ensure that
   AES-256 is not used:

    default_etypes = arcfour-hmac-md5 des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5
    default_etypes_des = des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5

   Problem analyzed by Markus Moeller <markus_moeller at compuserve.com>.

 o Code for shutting down idle sockd processes put back and can be
   enabled again, if desired.  It is not recommended for busy servers
   however as performance may be slightly degraded.

 o Fix bug related to clients using MSG_PEEK and GSSAPI on Linux.
   Problem found by Markus Moeller <markus_moeller at compuserve.com>.

 o Don't print warning if accept(2) fails when started with the -N<k> option.
   When started with the -N option, it is expected that accept(2) will
   fail in 1/k of the cases.  Instead just log a debug message about it.

   Should fix problem reported by Mark Sinner <mark.sinner@db.com.example.org>.

 o The fflush() wrapper function did not handle a NULL argument.
   Reported by "Kirby Zhou" <kirbyzhou@sohu-rd.com.example.org> and
   Victor Sologoubov <victor0@rambler.ru.example.org>

 o Fix libsocks upnpcleanup() linking problem when compiled without
   libminiupnpc.
   Problem reported by Kyle Thurow <krthurow@gmail.com.example.com> and
   Adam Prato <adam.prato@gmail.com.example.com>.

 o Assert failure related to message passing on some 64-bit architectures
   fixed.  Problem reported by Soner Tari <soner@comixwall.org.example.com>.

 o The capi/socks.h file was not correctly installed.
   Problem reported by Soner Tari <soner@comixwall.org.example.com>.

 o Compilation fixes for OpenSuse 11.1.
   Problem reported by Markus Moeller (markus_moeller at compuserve.com).

 o Compilation fix for config_parse.y compilation without YYDEBUG.
   Problem reported by Markus Moeller (markus_moeller at compuserve.com).

 o Compilation fixes for AIX 6.1.
   Problem reported by Ralf Wenk <iz-dante-0910@hs-karlsruhe.de.example.com>.
   Tested by Marcel Augenstein.

***
***  Tuesday, October 27, 2009 -- Dante v1.2.0
***

 o Improvements to client thread compatibility.  The client
   library should now be mostly thread safe.

 o Solaris privilege model support.  Based on patch from
   Mayuresh Nirhali <Mayuresh.Nirhali@Sun.COM.example.com> & co.

 o Make support for the socks 5 version described in draft-5.05 be
   configurable.  Before this was always enabled, but it breaks clients
   based on NEC socks code in some cases as they use the same bit to
   mean something completely different.
   A new option has been added to sockd.conf to enable it:
   "compatibility: draft-5.05".  Unless explicitly enabled, the Dante
   server will not use the socks 5.05 draft specification.

   Problem found by Markus Moeller (markus_moeller at compuserve.com).

 o Don't leak username/passwords provided to us for local authentication
   to upstream proxy server when server-chaining.  Error reported by
   Mathieu DELAPLACE <mathieu.delaplace@gmail.com.example.com>.

 o Fixed a bug/oversight that imposed an artificial limit on the number
   of sockd processes that could be created, even when the load required
   more.

 o Slight improvement of configuration parsing in an attempt to avoid
   confusing non-qualified hostnames with NIC interface names.

 o The default connect-timeout/negotiate-timeout has been reduced from
   120 seconds to 30 seconds.  The "connecttimeout" name has also been
   deprecated in favour of "timeout.negotiate".

 o Separate iotimeouts can be set for udp and tcp clients.  The "iotimeout"
   object has also been deprecated in favour of "timeout.io".

 o New configure option: "--disable-drt-fallback".
   Used to disable the attempted automatic fallback to a direct route
   if there are no usable proxy routes.  Default is, as before,
   automatic fallback.

 o Added a new option: "udp.connectdst".  Controls whether the server
   should connect udp sockets to the destination.
   The default for this release is yes, which improves performance,
   but _may_ be incompatible with some udp-based application protocols.

   Please let us know if you experience problems with some applications
   no longer working.

 o Markus Moeller (markus_moeller at compuserve.com) contributed support
   for GSSAPI encryption/authentication (RFC 1961) to both the socks
   server and socks client.  Many thanks to Markus for this and for a
   lot of help in testing it.

 o Fixed problem with connection close before accept on HPUX.
   Based on patch from Reine Persson <reine.persson@skatteverket.se>.

 o Support for SunOS 4 and Solaris 2.5.1 removed.

 o Added gethostbyaddr prototype for compilation on FreeBSD v6.2.
   Patch from "Igor Mozolevsky" <igor@hybrid-lab.co.uk>.

 o Fix getifa compilation problem on Solaris 8.
   Reported by "Thomas" <dante@birdhouse.ch.example.com>.

 o Patch from Markus Moeller (markus_moeller at compuserve.com),
   to limit the range of udp-ports used between the socks-client
   and the Dante server.

 o By default, try to auto-add direct routes for all addresses on the LAN.
   To disable it, set SOCKS_AUTOADD_LANROUTES to "no".

 o Fix bug that caused problems with certain combinations of
   bind(2)/accept(2)/close(2).
   Reported by Markus Moeller (markus_moeller at compuserve.com).

 o Fix bug that erroneously blocked the bind request from some clients.
   Reported by Markus Moeller (markus_moeller at compuserve.com).

 o Add support for environment variables SOCKS4_SERVER, SOCKS5_SERVER,
   HTTP_PROXY, and UPNP_IGD.
   If set, they specify the socks v4, socks v5 server, http proxy,
   or UPNP-enabled ID to use, without the need for a socks.conf.

   This should make it possible to run socksify with reasonable results
   even without a socks.conf, as long as one of these new environment
   variables are set correctly.

 o Auto-add direct routes for all gateways.  Should make the client
   a little more user-friendly by not having to specify "direct" routes
   for the proxyserver any longer.

 o More fine grained marking of when to mark a proxy route as "bad" so that
   it will not be used again by the same client.

   Also add a new variable to config.h, MAX_ROUTE_FAILS, determining
   how many times a route can fail before being blacklisted.  Default
   is one (same semantics as before there was a variable to control this).

 o Fix bug that could prevent password authentication from working
   on some systems. Spotted by
   Nathan Johnson <n.johnson@vanderbilt.edu.example.com>.

 o Add configure option --without-glibc-secure, which disables check for
   the glibc variable __libc_enable_secure. Creates undesired dependencies
   for packaging.  Reported by Mathieu CHOUQUET-STRINGER
   <mathieu.chouquet-stringer@sgcib.com.example.com>.

 o New getifaddrs() compatibility function, taken from Heimdal-1.2.1.

 o (Open)Solaris sa_len compilation problem fixed.
   Reported by Markus Moeller (markus_moeller at compuserve.com).

 o New version of the BSD version of "external.rotation: route",
   from Christoph Badura <bad@bsd.de.example.com>.

 o Support for interface names in sockd rules, and in the destination
   address for socks routes.

   Should make it easier to set up direct routes for local lan in
   the client (specify all local interface names in route statements),
   and block connections to e.g. loopback addresses (specify the the
   loopback interface name in a block rule) in the server.

 o UPnP support in the client, using the miniupnp library by
   Thomas Bernard (http://miniupnp.free.fr/).

   UPnP is a protocol implemented by many home/small-business routers
   and adsl-modems.  It allows you to dynamically open up ports on
   the router for accepting incoming connections, as well as figuring
   out what the external ipaddress of the router is.

   Dante uses this to make socksify of ftp/bittorent/etc programs
   work via the UPnP router.

   Note that only the miniupnp library with release date 2009/09/21
   or later is expected to work with Dante.

 o Be less strict about bind in the client.  The standards says
   it is expected that the client first performs a connect via
   the socks server, but it seems some/many socks servers support
   the client requesting a bind without a previous connect, so we
   assume that is the case in the client from now on.

 o Changed the magic bytes that indicate the client is requesting
   use of the Dante-specific bind extension from 0x00000000 to
   0xffffffff, as part of the process to become less strict about
   the bind command requiring a previous connection.

 o Don't zero password in client if we read it from environment, or
   it will not work the next time the same client process tries to
   authenticate to the server.
   Found by Pavel Fedin <fedin@matek.ru.example.com>.

   That mail address no longer works.  Please contact us if you have
   another address for Mr. Fedin.

 o Add support for "group:" syntax to rules, similar to "user:" statement.
   Requested by Don Harvie <donharvi@au1.ibm.com.example.com>

 o Close connection to PAM server each time we get an error-reply from
   it, fixing a bug.
   Patch from Robert Marcano <robert@marcanoonline.com.example.com>.

 o Incorrect assert fixed. Problem reported by
   "d binderman" <dcb314@hotmail.com.example.com>.

 o Log close of client-rule with correct command.
   Fixes bug reported by Tom Vandenbelt <tvandenb@au1.ibm.com.example.com>.

 o Update to autoconf 2.61 and libtool 1.5.26.

***
***  Monday, January 16, 2006 -- Dante v1.1.19

   and Tommy Chan for doing the port.  Great work.  AIX 4.2.1 should work.

 o share some of the client interposition code with the server;
   lets libwrap (and any other external library) use the
   hostname/hostaddress cache too, making things faster for
   those using libwrap.

 o always call gettimedout() regardless of select(), fixes an atleast
   theoretically possible problem.
   Brought up by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se.example.com).

 o assume the globally allowed methods are already set when parsing
   the rules.  Allows more checking/warning about "strange" rules.

 o fix a bug so portranges get parsed again, instead of reporting
   syntax error.

 o some cleanup/generalization in preparation for cryptography
   support.

 o in the case of the commands "bindreply" and "udpreply",
   "method" based itself on the controlconnection rather than the
   remote "reply".  Corrected to base itself on the remote reply.

 o when printing authinfo, include what the name of authmethod used
   is.

 o removed the "feature" that a user listed with the same name as
   a method would be considered special; too complex for practical
   use.  No more magic names.

 o clientrules now also take a method field, only non-socks
   method can be listed there of course; currently that's "none"
   and "rfc931".

 o call gethostbyname2() internally instead of gethostbyname();
   fixes a client problem present in some environments.
   Problem described by Per Hedeland (per@erix.ericsson.se.example.com).

Special compatibility notes for users upgrading from
previous versions of Dante:
  Server part:
    -  In the previous versions the "method" field in the rules
       specifying bind/udp-replies wasn't used entirely correct;
       it used the socksclient as the source when matching the
       method field, rather than the source of the reply, a
       non-socks connection.

       The correct usage should be that the method field is relative
       to the sourceaddress, and the sourceaddress for replies is
       a "non-socks" connection.  Special care might have to be
       taken to not accidently block the replies since most of them
       can only be using method "none" (the only other alternative
       is "rfc931").

    -  The "feature" that a "user" listed with the same name as
       a "method" would be considered special has been removed.
       Instead "client-rules" now take a "method" specification on
       the same form as the "socks-rules".  They also use the global
       method line in the same way as socks-rules.

    -  The feature that "libwrap: rfc931" would include the rfc931
       (ident) name in logging has been removed.  This functionality
       should instead be provided by adding a additional rule,
       almost identical to the rule with "libwrap: rfc931", before
       the "libwrap: rfc931" rule.

       The only difference is that the added rule should have
       "method: rfc931" specified instead of "libwrap: rfc931".
       "libwrap: rfc931" should also be removed from the old rule.

       The first rule will try to do send a rfc931 query to the
       client address.  If that fails, Dante moves on to the next
       rule, which in this case does not require a successful
       rfc931 lookup.  Refer to example/sockd.conf for more
       information.
